# AHB-to-APB-BUS-Bridge
This is part of AMBA Bus architecture and I am developing to handle the byte by byte transaction from master to peripherals. The AHB stands for advanced high speed bus interface that act as master and APB stands for Advanced Peripheral bus that act as slave . Thus, developing the interface using bridge to transfer the data.
